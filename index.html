          <h2> Problem Statement:
            Teachers are not getting compensated!! </h2>
          <p> Children of united states today are on a decline of education due to the wages of teachers being so low.

Who is experiencing the problem? Our everyday youth and young adults of America.

What is the problem? Education being such a must in todays world the last thing we need is teachers not getting compensated the wages they deserve

Where does the problem present themselves? After a year after year survey of our elementary, middle, and high schoolers math and reading scores dropping.

Why does it matter? If we don’t come together to stand up for our teachers and educators what will education be in the next 10 years? </p>
